- npm publish all necessary packages
- tailwind 100% coverage. ensure whatever HOF and such existed before have a matching class in tailwind
- nextjs support with demos/examples
- add logo and domain name to everything (the dark svg is dark text, the light is light text)
  - readme
  - docs
  - demos
- ensure the word "typewritingclass" is broken up into "Typewriting Class" when written everywhere
- astro docs has some markdown that isn't getting rendered
- use bun as the primary package manager in all readmes and docs
- use the frontend-design skill to make a few versions of custom astro starlight themes for the docs (add a debug picker so i can choose between them)
- add lots of actually cool and helpful utility HOFs to docs so people can get a vibe for how extensible this is
- make sure our theming implementation (default and custom) 1:1 with tailwind's shapes for those
- register vscode extension (what do you need from me to do this? i have previously published a vscode extension and have an account under csimmonswork@gmail.com)
