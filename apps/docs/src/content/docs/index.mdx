## Why Typewriting Class?

<CardGrid>
  <Card
    title="One import"
    icon="puzzle"
  >
    `import { tw } from 'typewritingclass'` -- chain utilities, modifiers, and
    shorthands off a single object. Full autocomplete, zero config.
  </Card>
  <Card
    title="TypeScript-native"
    icon="seti:typescript"
  >
    Utilities are functions, not string conventions. Full autocomplete, type
    checking, and refactoring support out of the box.
  </Card>
  <Card
    title="Property-access tokens"
    icon="rocket"
  >
    Every utility is a property on `tw` -- `tw.bg.blue500`, `tw.p(4)`,
    `tw.hover(tw.bg.blue600)`. No string conventions, just dot-access with full
    IntelliSense.
  </Card>
  <Card
    title="Dynamic when needed"
    icon="random"
  >
    Wrap runtime values with `dynamic()` and use `dcx()` -- the compiler emits
    CSS custom properties and a tiny runtime handles the rest.
  </Card>
</CardGrid>
